in this video I'll show you how you can
0:01
connect Vappy to your Nitan AI agents
0:03
and workflows so you can actually call
0:04
those using this voice assistant and get
0:06
some response back and also have them do
0:08
the normal operations inside of the N10
0:10
workflow so I'm just going to demo this
0:12
quickly with the super simple AI agent
0:14
here which is only a job is to get the
0:16
weather from a certain place so I'm just
0:18
going to click on talk to assistant
0:20
right now and we are going to call this
0:21
weather tool in N10
0:27
hello where would you like to get the
0:28
weather from today i would like to get
0:30
the weather from Prague today
0:33
just a
0:34
sec the weather in Prague is currently
0:37
clear with a temperature of
0:38
approximately
0:39
12.7Â° and a humidity of 49% if you need
0:43
more details or weather for another
0:45
location just let me know so we're going
0:48
to start us off inside of Bappy all you
0:49
need to do is go over to the Vapy
0:51
website and in here you can just go over
0:52
to the open dashboard or click on sign
0:55
up and you will be able to sign up to
0:56
Vappy once you've done that you will be
0:58
in a new account like this and as I said
1:01
this is super cheap you get a,000 free
1:03
minutes every month using Vappy so
1:05
that's super generous of them so I'm
1:07
going to start off in a fresh account
1:09
here I just made where we have your our
1:11
assistants and all we need to do in here
1:13
to make these assistants and then make
1:16
them actually call the NSM files is
1:18
starting with clicking on create
1:20
assistant and in here we can just call
1:22
this one NSN tutorial there we go we can
1:27
use a blank template and we can click on
1:28
create assistant now in here what we
1:31
need to do you can configure the model
1:34
the transcriber the voice the tools the
1:36
analysis and the advanced as you can see
1:38
you can either click on this or you can
1:40
just scroll to the section so we can
1:42
just scroll down first of all we have
1:43
the model this is something we're going
1:45
to set so we're just going to to make
1:47
this work with the weather API we can
1:49
say that the first message this is what
1:51
the AI is going to say when we actually
1:52
call it so I just added a really simple
1:54
first message saying "Hello where would
1:56
you like to get the weather from today?"
1:57
And then a really simple system prompt
1:59
because this is just a tutorial now it's
2:00
connected to N10 saying "You are a
2:02
pleasant assistant your job is to find
2:04
the weather in the place city area that
2:06
you that the user wants uh to find the
2:08
to find the weather you use the weather
2:10
tool." And as you can see we are now
2:11
asking it to use the weather tool to
2:13
find the weather in that area so what we
2:15
need to do is we need to scroll down or
2:16
just click on tool here to scroll down
2:18
to the tools section and we are going to
2:20
click on the tools and we want to select
2:23
a tool but as you see we don't have a
2:25
tool because we actually need to create
2:26
the weather tool that we just set in the
2:28
system prompt so go ahead and click on
2:30
the create new tool you will be
2:33
redirected to the tools section inside
2:35
of app here and we need to click on no
2:38
tool or we need to click on create tool
2:40
up here and we need to click on the
2:43
function and we are going to call this
2:46
tool as I said earlier we're going to
2:48
call this tool the weather tool and
2:50
we're going to give a quick description
2:52
here saying call this tool to get the
2:54
weather in a certain place and now we're
2:55
going to scroll down to the parameter
2:58
settings here because we or the
2:59
parameters because we are actually going
3:00
to add the parameters So just click on
3:03
add a property here which is going to be
3:05
called the place because this is the
3:07
place where we want to actually find the
3:09
weather from and then the description is
3:10
just going to be this is the place city
3:12
area that the weather will be retreat
3:14
from this is be going to be a type
3:16
string of course then we're just going
3:17
to click on apply and once we've done
3:20
that we actually need to go ahead and we
3:21
can just save this for now we need to go
3:23
ahead and find the server settings
3:25
server URL because the server URL is
3:27
actually going to be the NN web hook
3:30
trigger URL which we are going to make
3:32
now so we are in a fresh NN portfolio
3:34
here and we're just going to click on
3:36
add first step and that is of course
3:37
going to be the web hook uh step and we
3:40
are just going to click on that and we
3:41
are going to set this to a post method
3:44
first of all then we're going to copy
3:46
this test URL for the testing for now
3:48
we're going to paste that inside of here
3:52
and once we've done that we can actually
3:53
go ahead and save again now we're
3:54
actually now we actually have set up our
3:57
weather tool so we can go ahead and go
3:59
back to our assistant here in the end
4:01
tutorial and we can already actually
4:04
just before we do that we can go ahead
4:06
and go to the tools section and we can
4:08
add our tool here so you can just click
4:10
on the weather tool so now it has the
4:12
weather tool and we can publish this
4:13
agent or this assistant and now we can
4:16
actually go ahead and talk to the
4:17
assistant but before we do that we need
4:19
to actually go ahead and we need to test
4:22
this or listen for test events because
4:24
now we want to trigger this weather tool
4:26
so let's go back to Vappy and we can
4:28
talk to the assistant
4:34
hello where would you like to get the
4:36
weather from today i would like to get
4:38
the weather from Prague today
4:41
one
4:42
moment i apologize but uh it seems There
4:45
you go as you can see we now got the web
4:46
hookup triggered so we can see what we
4:48
got from that web as you can see we got
4:50
the place prog here which is what we're
4:52
going to do we're going to use h in the
4:55
later parts in this workflow so we're
4:57
just going to use a simple AI agent here
4:59
so you can just click on AI agent and we
5:01
are just going to not be using connected
5:03
chat trigger we're going to use define
5:05
below and in here we are just going to
5:08
add or first of all we're just going to
5:09
say find the weather for and we can
5:12
scroll down to the body and the tool
5:14
call so we can find the place which is
5:17
going to be Prague we can put that in
5:19
find the weather for Prague and now what
5:22
we need to do is we need to just go
5:24
ahead and we can add a tool here which
5:26
is obviously going to be the open
5:27
weather API so you can just search for
5:29
open weather
5:31
API open weather there we go open
5:34
weather map tool and we can go ahead and
5:37
if you don't have an open weather
5:38
account you can just go ahead and use
5:39
that or you can do something else with
5:41
this AI agent if you don't want to
5:42
create one just let the AI found uh
5:45
define the city because that is then
5:46
going to go ahead and define that city
5:49
which came from the web hook and we're
5:50
just going to use a simple open AI chat
5:53
here for the AI agent which is going to
5:55
be TP4 is fine for testing and we are
5:58
just going to add a little web hook
6:01
response here respond to web hook and
6:04
now we're going to let this be as first
6:06
incoming item but in this web hook right
6:08
now we actually need to change this from
6:10
respond to using respond to webbook node
6:14
and once we've done that uh we are going
6:16
to get a little error and I'm going to
6:18
just trigger that for now and we can see
6:20
what what happens so we just need to
6:22
click on test workflow here come back
6:23
over to the vapid dashboard click on
6:26
test or talk to assistant hello where
6:29
would you like to get the weather from
6:30
today i would like to get the weather
6:32
from Prague today
6:34
uh give me a moment
6:39
it seems there was an issue retrieving
6:41
the weather information for as you can
6:43
hear it was an issue retrieving the
6:45
weather information the reason is as you
6:46
can see we actually managed to send back
6:48
the response here which was something
6:50
looking like this first of all this is
6:52
not something we can send back to vap so
6:54
we need to clean that up secondly we
6:57
also actually need to send a response to
7:00
vap in a certain format so the VA uh
7:03
documentation here is looking really
7:05
weird for some reason they have some
7:07
HTML issues here but we actually need to
7:09
go over to the custom tools section so
7:12
we just need to scroll down to this part
7:15
here once you click on the custom tools
7:17
inside of the vapid documentation scroll
7:19
down to this part hopefully when you are
7:21
seeing this video you don't have to deal
7:22
with this uh freaking HTML issue here
7:25
but you can just copy this little JSON
7:27
right here head back over to your annot
7:31
workflow here and you can go ahead and
7:33
change this from first incoming item to
7:35
JSON and we just need to paste that in
7:37
here and now the tool call ID is going
7:41
to be so this is the format that mapping
7:43
needs to actually use the result that we
7:45
got from the the AI agent here so first
7:48
of all we need to change this uh change
7:50
it to expression and we need to go ahead
7:52
and add the tool call ID which is going
7:55
to be from as you can see the we had the
7:58
tool calls here and the tool call at
8:00
index zero grab that ID drag it over
8:03
here and for the result we're obviously
8:05
going to use the result we got from the
8:08
AI agent but the the thing is we cannot
8:11
use this um this markdown format with
8:14
these back slash ends so we actually are
8:17
going to go ahead and ask the AI agent
8:19
to make this a bit more simple so we
8:21
just told it only output one sentence no
8:24
new lines so now we can go ahead and
8:26
actually uh save this and we can test
8:28
this workflow again so we can click on
8:29
test workflow we can go back over to our
8:31
Vapid dashboard and we can talk to the
8:33
assistant again
8:37
hello where would you like to get the
8:38
weather from today i would like to get
8:40
